<h1> TelegramBOT with MySql </h1>


This is my new project only to test how a TelegramBOT should work with MySql Storage.

---

To use it you will need:



> Download telepot lib with: $ pip install telepot

>Create a txt file: botkey.txt

>Add the telegram API token of your bot.

>Import the Database to Mysql using the code from "telegram_bot.sql".

Working... please wait....
